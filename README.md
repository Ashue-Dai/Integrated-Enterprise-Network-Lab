üè¢ Integrated Enterprise Network Lab

üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates a segmented enterprise network using GNS3.  
The goal is to simulate standard corporate IT infrastructure with VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP configuration, and server deployment.

üìÑ [Project Report](Screenshots/Docs/Integrated_Enterprise_Report.pdf)

üèóÔ∏è [Topology](Screenshots/topology.png)

* Routers: Inter-VLAN routing & subinterfaces  
* Switches: VLAN segmentation & trunking  
* Servers: DNS, Web, FTP  
* PCs: Client devices for testing connectivity  

‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
* GNS3 (Network simulation)  
* Cisco Router Images (IOSv)  
* Switches (vIOS-L2)  
* Windows/Linux VMs for server farm  

üìù Configurations

üîπ VLAN & Switch Configuration
* VLANs: 10, 20, 30, 35, 99, 100  
* Switchports assigned to respective departments  
* 802.1Q trunk ports configured

üîπ Router / Inter-VLAN Routing
* Subinterfaces on routers configured for VLAN routing  
* Routing enabled between all internal VLANs  
* Guest VLAN isolated with ACLs  
  - [Routing Config](Screenshots/routing_config.png)  
* Subinterfaces on routers configured for VLAN routing  
* Routing enabled between all internal VLANs  
* Guest VLAN isolated with ACLs  
* Access Control Lists (ACLs) implemented:  
  - VLAN 10 & 20 cannot access the server farm  
  - VLAN 99 cannot access any other VLAN

üîπ DHCP Configuration
* DHCP pools created for dynamic VLANs  
* Static IPs reserved for servers and management devices  
* ip helper-address configured where DHCP is centralized

üîπ Connectivity Test
* Ping and file transfer tested between VLANs and servers

üîÑ Results / Observations
* VLAN segmentation successfully isolates departments  
* Inter-VLAN routing enables communication where allowed  
* Guest VLAN remains isolated after  
* DHCP pools dynamically assign IP addresses correctly  
* Server farm accessible by authorized VLANs only  

‚úÖ Advantages
- Clear VLAN segmentation improves network organization and security  
- Inter-VLAN routing ensures controlled communication between departments  
- DHCP pools simplify IP address management  
- Server farm setup (DNS, Web, FTP) provides realistic enterprise simulation  
- Easy to expand for additional services or devices in the future  

‚ö†Ô∏è Problems Faced / Challenges
- Linux Web Server & Ubuntu FTP Server Connectivity: Could not connect to main network despite multiple reinstallations. Working on resolving interface and routing issues.  
- pfSense Installation: Only one interface was active; adding a second interface failed, so the full firewall setup was not completed.  
- General GNS3 challenges: Ensuring proper routing and trunk configurations between multiple VLANs and devices.
